Above is a picture of me that you may recognise, however it has been altered to allow my primary dreams to be shown. I hope you enjoy my memories</p>

	<h2><strong>School 1</strong></h2>
		<p>I stayed here for one whole year. Prep. i remember my families name being coinsidendly on one of the bricks that had a list of important people, and I always thought it was for us. I remember literally nothing</p>

			<h2><strong>School 2</strong></h2>
			<p>this school was a private all girls school. I made alot of friends, but i lost myself. My sister and I were not fit for the life of conformity that our school gave us. So we moved, btu at the school I had lots of opportunities. I played trombone and was in choir. This was my experience in my second primary school</p>
			<P>heres the school: <a href="https://www.lowtherhall.vic.edu.au/">check it out</a></P>

			<h2><strong>School 3</strong></h2>
			<p>This was my final school until I reached high school. I started in year 4 to year 6. I picked up saxaphone and joined another choir despite not being able to sing. I learned alot of basic life lessons and continued my passions to highschool.</p>
