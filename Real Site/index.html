<h2><strong>WELCOME TO MY PAGE</strong></h2>
		<p>hello. my name is morgan. this is a page dedicated to a review of the different stages of my life. In this page I have included three different life stages;n pre-kindergarten, primary school, and highschool. i hope you enjoy a virtual tour of my life and a folio of memorable photos. because i need to bulk up this page let me tell you about myself with no copyright. I am 168 centimeters tall. i am a brunette, i like math and art and animation. my goal and dream is life is to become an animator or character designer. my dads friend, nick was a background designer for a game me and my siblings used to play all the time, whenever we beat it we would always scream and yell when his name appeared in the credits. this inspired me, i want to do something like that. my favourite colours are pink and purple, and my favourite animals are jellyfish. My favouritre activity is hot chipppies on the wednesday with no spaces.</p>
